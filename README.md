# Image-Retargetting
My first year project (2014.09~2015.08) under advisor Prof. Changick-Kim. Source Code open is not available, but only executable file (project funded by Hancom Company). 

Paper is published for this project:

My contribution: building OpenGL Platform and implementing Image Retargeting Quality Assessment.
